## Features
- No need to physically rotate screen, the rotation is set correctly in software.
- Manual mesh bed leveling with 7x7 grid. Why buy 3D Touch when you can do the same by yourself?
- Linear Advance
- Pre-calibrated E-steps. I've set it to 833.7 steps/mm (factory is 768). Change it in menu if it doesn't work for you.
- Pre-calibrated XY bed skew compensation. Change it in menu if it doesn't work for you.
- MPC hotend temperature control (bed is still PID). Zero overshoot, maintains precise set-point compared. You can run auto-tune in menu if it doesn't work correctly.
- Nozzle park, pause and filament change.
- Bezier curve and arc GCode support.
- Print most-recent file pop-up on SD card plug.
- Plug heatsink fan to PB0 pin and get fan auto-shutdown when hotend is cool.
- And moreâ€¦ (checkout config files in [/config](https://github.com/konradmb/kp3s-marlin/tree/master/config) directory)
